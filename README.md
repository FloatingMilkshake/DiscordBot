# DiscordBot
my first Discord bot, written in C# with DSharpPlus!  
the code is probably terrible because i don't know what i'm doing. but it works!  
and yes i know the repo could have a better name but i'm dumb and can't think of anything, maybe i'll change it later

huge thank-you to [Erisa](https://github.com/Erisa) for putting up with my constant questions as i was learning how to do this! i really do appreciate it.

# want to run it yourself for some reason?
- clone the repo
- copy `.env-example` to `.env`
- replace `yourtoken` with your actual bot token in `.env`
- run `docker-compose up -d`
