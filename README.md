# MechanicalMilkshake
my first Discord bot, written in C# with DSharpPlus!

the code is probably terrible because i don't know what i'm doing. but it works!

huge thank you to [Erisa](https://github.com/Erisa) for putting up with my constant questions!! you have no idea how much i appreciate it. â™¥

# want to run it yourself for some reason?
- clone the repo
- copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
- in `config.json`, provide values for at least `botToken` and `homeChannel`. other variables are optional, but some functionality may not work without them (the bot should tell you what's missing though if i did things right).
 - run `docker-compose up -d`

 # i'm not good at this
 ...so feel free to open an issue or PR if you notice anything wrong or have a suggestion! i'm all ears. please do note though that i have some [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
