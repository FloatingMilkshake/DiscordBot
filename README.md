# DiscordBot
my first Discord bot, written in C# with DSharpPlus!

the code is probably terrible because i don't know what i'm doing. but it works!

i know the repo & project could probably have a better name but i'm dumb and can't think of anything, maybe i'll change it later. not that it matters a whole lot, it doesn't affect the actual bot user's name anyway.

huge thank-you to [Erisa](https://github.com/Erisa) for putting up with my constant questions!! i really do appreciate it.

# want to run it yourself for some reason?
- clone the repo
- copy `.env-example` to `.env`
- in `.env`:
  - replace `yourtoken` with your actual bot token
  - replace `homechannelid` with the id of a channel where you'd like startup messages to appear
 - run `docker-compose up -d`
