# MechanicalMilkshake
my first Discord bot, written in C# with DSharpPlus!

the code is probably terrible because i don't know what i'm doing. but it works!

huge thank-you to [Erisa](https://github.com/Erisa) for putting up with my constant questions!! i really do appreciate it.

# want to run it yourself for some reason?
- clone the repo
- copy `.env-example` to `.env`
- in `.env`, provide values for at least `BOT_TOKEN` and `HOME_CHANNEL`. other variables are optional, but some functionality may not work without them (the bot should tell you what's missing though if i did things right).
 - run `docker-compose up -d`

 # i'm not good at this
 ...so feel free to open an issue or PR if you notice anything wrong or have a suggestion! i'm all ears.
